Thanks for downloading django-profiles.

To install it, run the following command inside this directory:

    python setup.py install

Or if you'd prefer you can simply place the included ``profiles``
directory somewhere on your Python path, or symlink to it from
somewhere on your Python path; this is useful if you're working from a
Subversion checkout.

Note that this application requires Python 2.4 or later, and a
functional installation of Django 1.3 or newer. You can obtain Python from
http://www.python.org/ and Django from http://www.djangoproject.com/.
