==================
django-la-profiles
==================

*This is a fork of James Bennett's django-profiles app, with the additions
of a test project, tests, and sphinxified documentation.*

This is a fairly simple user-profile management application for
Django_, designed to make the management of site-specific user
profiles as painless as possible. It requires a functional
installation of Django 1.3 or newer and provides a useful complement
to `django-registration`_, but has no other dependencies.

For installation instructions, see the file "INSTALL.txt" in this
directory; for instructions on how to use this application, and on
what it provides, see the file "overview.txt" in the "docs/"
directory.
